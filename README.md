# influencers-in-instagram

All you need to do is write:
<b>pip install -r requirements.txt</b>

edit the <b>cool_places</b> file by adding cool bars/restaurnts/venues you know of.

Then write:
<b>python main.py</b>

The script will output two files -
one is: <b>influencers</b>
and the other: <b>influencers_ordered</b>

As the name hints, the second file removes duplicates and orders the influencers by amount of followers (decreasing).

Don't forget to put your own foursquare and instagram client_id and client_secret in <b>config.py</b>

Godspeed.
